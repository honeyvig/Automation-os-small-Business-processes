# Automation-os-small-Business-processes
AI expert to help build and manage automation processes within our small business. The ideal candidate will have experience with ChatGPT, Gemini, Make, Monday.com, CRMs, and WhatsApp integrations. Your role will involve creating seamless workflows and automation to optimize our operations. If you have a strong background in these areas and a passion for efficiency, we want to hear from you.
=============================
Below is a Python-based workflow to help build and manage automation processes involving tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Make.com, Monday.com, CRMs, and WhatsApp. The solution focuses on using APIs and libraries to integrate these tools seamlessly into your business operations.
Python Code for Workflow Automation
1. Set Up Environment

Install required libraries:

pip install openai requests flask pywhatkit monday requests_toolbelt

2. API Integration

Python code to connect with various tools.
ChatGPT (OpenAI) Integration

import openai

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

def ask_chatgpt(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=500
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

Monday.com Integration

import requests

MONDAY_API_KEY = 'YOUR_MONDAY_API_KEY'
MONDAY_API_URL = "https://api.monday.com/v2"

def create_monday_item(board_id, group_id, item_name):
    query = """
    mutation {
        create_item (board_id: %s, group_id: "%s", item_name: "%s") {
            id
        }
    }
    """ % (board_id, group_id, item_name)

    headers = {
        "Authorization": MONDAY_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }

    response = requests.post(MONDAY_API_URL, json={"query": query}, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

WhatsApp Integration

import pywhatkit as kit

def send_whatsapp_message(phone_number, message):
    kit.sendwhatmsg_instantly(phone_no=phone_number, message=message)

Make.com (Integromat) Integration

def trigger_make_scenario(webhook_url, data):
    response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=data)
    return response.status_code, response.text

3. Creating Automation Workflows

Build automation processes connecting the above tools:

def automation_workflow(task_details):
    # Step 1: Analyze task with ChatGPT
    analysis = ask_chatgpt(f"Provide recommendations for: {task_details}")
    print("ChatGPT Analysis:", analysis)

    # Step 2: Create task in Monday.com
    monday_response = create_monday_item(
        board_id="12345678",
        group_id="new_group",
        item_name=task_details
    )
    print("Monday.com Task Created:", monday_response)

    # Step 3: Notify team via WhatsApp
    message = f"New task created: {task_details}\nDetails: {analysis}"
    send_whatsapp_message("+1234567890", message)
    print("WhatsApp Notification Sent")

    # Step 4: Trigger Make.com scenario
    webhook_url = "https://hook.make.com/YOUR_SCENARIO"
    scenario_response = trigger_make_scenario(webhook_url, {"task": task_details})
    print("Make.com Scenario Triggered:", scenario_response)

4. Real-Time Updates Using Flask

Create a web app to manage tasks in real-time.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/automate', methods=['POST'])
def automate_task():
    data = request.json
    task_details = data.get("task_details")
    if not task_details:
        return jsonify({"error": "Task details required"}), 400

    automation_workflow(task_details)
    return jsonify({"message": "Task automated successfully"}), 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

5. Future Improvements

    Gemini Integration: Extend automation by connecting Gemini APIs (if available).
    CRM Automation: Integrate your CRM to automatically update leads and opportunities.
    Dashboard: Use tools like Dash/Streamlit for a visual interface.

Steps to Deploy

    API Keys: Securely store and retrieve your API keys using environment variables or secret managers.
    Test Endpoints: Test each integration endpoint independently before running the complete workflow.
    Host the Application: Deploy the Flask app using platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.

Example Usage

automation_workflow("Follow-up with the new client and prepare a sales pitch.")

This will:

    Analyze the task using ChatGPT.
    Create an item on Monday.com.
    Notify team members via WhatsApp.
    Trigger a Make.com scenario for further processing.

By chaining these integrations, you can streamline and automate your small business operations efficiently.
